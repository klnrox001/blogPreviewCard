## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I practiced using flexbox more when creating the Blog Preview Card. I also used the media query function to ensure that the blog preview design could be accurately displayed when viewed on mobile devices. 

### Continued development

I would like to get more familiar with using "em" for my fonts and spacing instead of "pxx".
